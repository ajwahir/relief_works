# relief_works

In the times of some natural disasters like flood, cyclone etc there is a need for important and useful messages that should reach everyone. But, during that time there will be very limited network connection for communication via call, text messages or internet. 

The idea is to create an app with maybe google maps api, where we by default it will keep updating the essential map around your current location. Now, during the disaster in the map we have to add ðŸŽˆ, around you with important location with details of size of relief camp, nursing availability, food requirements, volunteer count/requirements etc. This can't be updated in real-time as there is no connectivity. The data will encoding and the soze of it should be small, say around 500KB So we might use the following approach somehow get the data - 

-> Long range WiFi routers carried by volunteers or by drone, so that when people's phone get connected the data is updated
-> Some person get a small internet connectivity and got the data updated, then the person can switch on thr hotspot and neighbours can get the data automatically and keep going. Everyone can keep the hotspot on by default.


Also the app will have authenticity check for the information and offline routing for navigation.

The goal is to make maximum information reach maximum of people in most efficient way, where there is no/less connectivity.
communicate volunteer/food requests etc.
